                <p id="paragraph-1">The W3schools website is a perfect example of a website that practices good proximity. <br> The elements on the websites are placed equally around each other with adequate distance around each of the elements.<br> Also, there is enough
                    spacing around each elements and sections of the website giving the overall website a wonderful and professional appearance. <br> This look makes it easy for any user to easily interact with the website. </p>

                <p id="paragraph-2">The momentum energy website is another website that practices good alignment. <br> Each elements on the website are well positioned relative to the entire website. <br> I also observed that each elements on the website are well padded
                    and well margine giving the overall website a wonderful and refreshing look. <br> This look makes it easy for any user to easily interact with the website. </p>

                <img class="image-3" src="images/IMG-4751.PNG" alt="An image illustrasting the importance of contrast" width="300">
                <p id="paragraph-3"> The choice of colors foe the photo comma website is what attracted me to the website. <br> While featuring a dark image as the backgorund, the other elements on the page are depicted with lighter and beautiful color. <br> This in turn
                    gives the website a very cool yet professional contrast. <br> Making it easy for users to be attracted to it and even want to explore the website.</p>
